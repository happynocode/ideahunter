# Reddit API Trending Functionality Research

## üìä Overview

This document summarizes research on Reddit API endpoints for discovering trending subreddits and integrating them into our "General" industry category for dynamic content discovery.

## üîç Reddit API Endpoints Explored

### Available Endpoints
1. **`/subreddits/popular`** - Most subscribed subreddits
   - Returns subreddits sorted by subscriber count
   - Good for finding established popular communities
   - Best for stable, high-quality content sources

2. **`/subreddits/new`** - Recently created subreddits
   - Shows newest subreddits on the platform
   - Can help identify emerging communities
   - Higher risk of low-quality or inactive subreddits

3. **`/subreddits/default`** - Default subreddits
   - Traditional "front page" subreddits
   - High quality and moderation standards
   - Safe choices for general content

4. **`/r/all/hot`** - Trending posts across all subreddits
   - Shows currently hot posts from all subreddits
   - Good for identifying which subreddits have viral content
   - Can help discover active communities

5. **`/r/all/rising`** - Rising posts across all subreddits
   - Shows posts gaining momentum
   - Early indicator of trending content
   - Useful for catching viral content early

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Findings

### What Reddit API Does NOT Have
- **No dedicated "trending subreddits" endpoint**
- No specific API for subreddit popularity changes over time
- No API for community growth rate metrics
- No real-time trending community discovery

### What We CAN Do
- Use `/subreddits/popular` for stable popular communities
- Monitor `/r/all/hot` and `/r/all/rising` to identify active subreddits
- Track which subreddits appear frequently in trending posts
- Use subscriber count as a proxy for popularity

## üéØ Implementation Recommendations

### For General Category Enhancement
1. **Static Popular Subreddits** (Already implemented)
   - r/AskReddit, r/funny, r/gaming, r/worldnews, etc.
   - Based on subscriber counts and general appeal

2. **Dynamic Discovery Strategy**
   - Run weekly discovery jobs using `/subreddits/popular`
   - Monitor `/r/all/hot` to identify active subreddits
   - Filter results to exclude NSFW, low-quality, or specialized content
   - Update general category subreddit list periodically

3. **Quality Filters**
   - Minimum subscriber threshold (10,000+)
   - English language preference
   - Exclude NSFW content
   - Avoid niche or specialized communities
   - Require meaningful public description

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration

### Edge Function: reddit-trending-discovery
- **Purpose**: Research and discover trending subreddits
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `/subreddits/popular`
  - `/subreddits/new` 
  - `/subreddits/default`
- **Output**: Filtered list of quality subreddits for general category
- **Schedule**: Can be run manually or scheduled weekly

### Integration with Existing System
- New general category added with ID: 240
- Contains 22 popular subreddits including requested r/AskReddit and r/IAMA
- Can be expanded dynamically using trending discovery function

   - Adjust subreddit selection based on startup idea generation success
   - Remove underperforming subreddits from rotation

3. **Seasonal/Event-Based Discovery**
   - Detect trending topics and events
   - Temporarily add relevant subreddits during viral events
   - Return to baseline after event passes

## üöÄ Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ General category created with ID 240
- ‚úÖ 22 popular subreddits added to INDUSTRY_MAPPING
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated (26 industries total)
- ‚úÖ Trending discovery Edge Function created
- ‚è≥ Function deployment (user will handle)
- ‚è≥ Testing and validation
- ‚è≥ Integration with daily scraping pipeline

## üìù Notes

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for general content discovery while the trending discovery function offers future expansion capabilities. The lack of a dedicated Reddit trending API means we rely on popularity metrics and manual curation for the best results.
